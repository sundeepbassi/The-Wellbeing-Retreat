 # The Wellbeing Retreat
 
 This project hopes to accomplish delivering lesson techniques on yoga and meditation to the users. Wellbeing has become an integral part of our lives. increasingly a work life balance enables us into living happier and fuller lives.

**UX**

**User Stories"

1. As a user i want to know that I have come to a site about self-improvement techniques mainly yoga and meditation.

2. As a user I want to be able to easily navigate around 
the site.

3. As a user I want to know what is yoga and meditaion?

4. As a user I want to have a list about the different types of yoga and meditation.

5. As a user I want to do a lesson on yoga and meditation.

6. As a user I want to see yoga and  meditation images.

7. As a user I want to be able to submit my first name, surname and email.

8. As a user I want to be able to use social media icons.




**The Goals of the user**
1. To learn about self-improvement techniques
2. To feel comfortable in being able to use these self-improvement techniques.
3. To gain confidence in using these self-improvement techniques.
4. To have a better sense of wellbeing.
5. To enjoy the experience and to feel at ease on the site.

**The Goals for the Business**
1. To give the user a positive and intuitive experience.
2. To give the user an opportunity to learn about self-improvement techniques.
3. To promote the benefits of yoga and meditation.
4. To reach out to a wider audience that have not considered yoga and meditation before.
5. To enable the user to learn some skills about yoga and meditation.

**Strategy**

 This project hopes to target anyone interested in learning about yoga and meditation. The target audience is mainly aimed at beginners. However this site aims to provide body/mind techniques to people that are interested in learning more about these techniques. 

 No age range has been specified as the aim is to make these self-improvement techniques available to all that are interested.

 Within the Code Institute User Experience module, one realised the overall importance this had  in planning the project.

 one formulated some questions to see what users would want from a Yoga and meditation site.

 1. What would you like to see about yoga and meditation on a site.
 
 2. what body/mind techniques would you like to learn about from the site?

 3. What information would you like to see on the site?

 4. What format would best enhance your learning i.e. lesson plans,video or audio?

 5. What social media contacts would you like to see incorporated on the site?

 The site was named The Wellbeing Retreat because one  wanted to give the users a feeling that they were about to enter a retreat from where they could switch off from the outside world.

 I initially had the idea of using the title Yogimed and realised that this may give the user the wrong impression. As the end of the  word maybe misinterpreted to mean medical.

 I also thought about using the title Harmony for the site as the remit was to use body/mind self-improvement techniques. I realised that this would be too confusing for users as a 
 E harmony site already exists for people wishing to date.

 I realised that The Wellbeing Retreat incorparated this feeling body/mind self improvement techniques and it was a place to go and learn.


 **Scope**

 **The skeletal** 

In the skeletal process I first of all did my basic plan on paper with an outline of how the site would be structured.

Then I used Balsamique to do a basic wireframe which i presented to my mentor and he recommended that I redo the wireframe so as to show better consistency and layout for the site. I appreciated his advice and I did an update of that wireframe.  As I was using Balsamique for the first time I had to get used to the functions.

 **Structure**

 **The Features**

 **features**

**Typography**
 
 How the Font and the background colour were used on the site, one did research especially in relation to accessibily for people with visual impairment.

 In considering the typograhy font for the site the article on Canva was helpful in viewing a number of fonts displayed on various websites. Bebas Neue was initially chosen however this was changed to Manjari. The benefit of viewing the text in Google Fonts enabled one to see the diffence in appearance with both fonts.
 
  Manjari was chosen because of the curviture and the shape appeared to be not too formal. At the same time considering it for a wellbeing project the font appeared to look somewhat wholistic and welcoming. Google Font recommended Montserrat to compliment Manjari. 

 One wanted to find typoghraphy and fonts that were both professional and had an aesthetic appeal. The Canva website showcased a number of fonts that created a good impression to the user.

 [Canva website](https://www.canva.com/learn/best-professional-fonts-use-website/)

 In another aricle on canva on how different fonts speak to you. There was a statement about how 
 
 "fonts help give personality to your design and help you communicate your message through visual cues.

 When seeing the Bebas Neue this clearly stood out in its representation as a therupeatic font, however it did not appear to be very appealing when tested in google fonts.

"Every font has its own personality; whether it's elegant, fun, cool, or relaxed. Read on for four styles of fonts to try in your designs."

Establish a Mood with Typography Carrie Cousins

[typography moods](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2012/02/19/establish-a-mood-with-typography/)

The next step was to see how font colours contrasted with the background colours. The article and display board were very useful.

How to Contrast Background and Foreground Colors in Web Design By Jeremy Girard on the ThoughtCo. Website. 

[Contrasting Colours](https://www.thoughtco.com/contrasting-foreground-background-colors-4061363)

[Contrast Checker](https://contrastchecker.com/)

 WebAIM website for Persons with Disabilities

 [Webaim](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)

Images taken to help decide best colour scheme for the site regarding background and foreground contrasts.  This was also to ensure that it was useable for people with visual impairments.

 **Background Colour** was set to #bbccff as this gave a nice contrast to the font text that is black.  The font also stood out better with this colour compared to the white background. With the white background it felt cold and sharp whereas with this colour it was warmer and more appealing to the eye.


 **Landing Page**

 I decided to keep the landing page simple because I remember when I studied a short course at Birmingham City University the lecturer telling us that the best websites incorporated simplicity into their design like Google that only have a plain landing page with a search engine in the middle.  Thereby the users are not overwhelmed with too much information.

 **Navigation**

 I initially thought about having the navigation under the main heading, however I changed my mind when I watched a video by Kierstan Traboulsi from Evolve Marketing web design.  Kierstan explained with research and eye tracking software they have found that users eyes go to the upper top left hand side of a site and they scroll down in a F shape on the page.  I realised for an optimum user eperience that it was best to use this F shape as a guide and to place the Navigation at the top left side of the page.

 The navigation menu bar was set to fixed; so that it would be easier for the user to navigate throughout the site, without having to scroll up constantly.

 I also decided that I wanted to have the navigation in text form and not in a navigation bar as this may distract from the simplicity and consistency of the site.

**No Background image**

I checked the Code Institute recommendation to read the article in the website usersnap.  However I decided that I did not want to put a background image on the site because I felt it may distract the user away from the purpose of the site which is to provide learning and a feeling of tranquility.  The article stated that video, animation and hero backgrounds had become popular.  However I think that although this may be good for some websites that it does not mean that this would be suitable for all websites.  My argument being that every site functions differently according to the service it provides to its users.  Therefore, The Wellbeing Retreats purpose is to provide learning and wellbeing and the simplicity in its style promotes this idea of calmness and wellbeing. I noticed that when I did my research on websites for yoga and meditation that although initially I did find the background images appealing however this distracted me from checking out some of the other sections on the site.

Web Design: When the Background Becomes the Main Stage

by Rebecca Vogels
Web Development

 **The Wellbeing retreat**

This main header I want to put on the right top side of the of the landing page so as to enable the user to feel that they are not inudated with too information. The main heading in itself will explain what the site is for.

**The Statement**

I decided to add a statememt under the landing page image to welcome users onto the site.

 **The Image on the Landing Page**

I initially thought about adding two images one for yoga and one for meditation but then I realised that one central image gave the landing page a focus.
 
 **Yoga/Meditation**

 I wanted to make a note here that the layout for both the Yoga and Meditation sections need to be the same. I want the user to feel consistency and uniformity on these pages therefore the  layout should be similar,simple and effective.  I decided putting both the Yoga and Meditation content next to each other was a good display for the user.  It also enabled the user to have a choice in what would be of interest to them.

 **The Yoga Section**

What is Yoga? /Where did it originate?

What are the techniques?

List the techniques

There will be a lesson on how to do one of the techniques.



 **The Meditation Section**

What is Meditation? /Where did it originate

What are the techniques?

List the techniques.

There will be a lesson on how to do one of the techniques.



 **Sign up Section**

The sign up section will have the following.

First Name and an input box.

Surname and and input box.

Email and and input box.

A submit button.

 **The Footer Section**

The footer will include icons for Twitter, facebook, instagram and Youtube. 

There will be copyright information at the bottom.

Again I do not want to put the footer ina different coloured area as I feel this may distract from the overall theme of the site.

I noticed that the sign up red submit button was being pressed tbat the social media icons opened up.  I used google developer tools to check what was going on and I noticed the both the social media and the sign up submit button overlapped.  I rectified this by adding margin-top: 100px; to the footer section and it rectified the problem.

 **Features Left to Implement**

I am thinking it would be good to have a section for teachers in the future.  Whereby teachers could have an information page about themselves and contact information.


There could also be a place to list a timetable of classes.  

I think with covid it has highlighted the importance of social distancing and conducting classes over the web through other media technologies such as zomm could be a good idea.

 **Validator Testing**

I did a number of validator tests and the main problem that needed to be dealt with was an error with the syntax to do with id.  in the code the validator showed me that there were duplicate id's being listed.  I removed the id's but then the right bottom side of the page became misaligned.

On the 19th of June, I had added and committed information that I had done in the readme.  Checking the next day I noticed that the information had not been added.  I will contact student support and the tutor supprt to check why this has happened.  I do save my work after every peace of work and I do the git add and git commit commands and regularly do a git push to ensure that my work has been sent to github.

The work that I submitted on the 19th of June 2021 was related to the right hand side of of the meditation section and how I had added the stucture and style to the right hand side of the meditation section.  I used the left and right about (id) markers to create to coloured temporary marker blocks to see if the structure was in alignment.  I found that the right hand side yoga section was shorter that the left hand side.  I used Google Developer tools to see why both sides were not equally balanced.  I found that the bottom margin was showing 100% on the left and although it was showing 100% on the right for the same input element, it still looked shorter on the right hand side.  I rectified the problem by increasing the right side value to 140%.

17 June 2021.  The logo was not resizing,  tutor support guided me in the correct way of checking my code in the validators.  Found main bug in the HTML the bracket by the id=(logo ) had a space stopped logo from resizing.

On the 22nd of June I could not upload an image and was guided by tutor support to do a validator check and a number of errors were shown. After removing the errors the page became misaligned. The problem was located in the id property and there were duplicate copies in the HTML.  I found the solution by relabelling the duplicate id tags and it resolved the problem.

 **Credits**

The code for the Meta data, implementing the boilerplate and implementing the folder and file structure was adopted from the Code Institute Love Running Walkthrough.

To set the font, remove default margins and padding was shown in the Love Running Walkthrough.

To set the navigation styles was shown in Love Running the Code Institute. I also learnt from deved to fix the navigation menu.

To set the style for the heading and logo was shown in the love running from the code institute.  I also checked on MDN Web docs on how to use the float.

[MDN Web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/float)

To set the changes to the navigation were shown in the love running video Code Institute.  I did try to set the navigation on the float left setting however it did not fit well with the logo.  

To set the style for navigation links was shown in the love running video Code Institute.

To install the hero image was shown in the love running video from Code Institute. The image was taken from iStock Getty images.

To construct the yoga and meditation sections were shown in the love running video by the Code Institue. However I had to do a sketch on paper, to check how the layout would look like for both the yoga and meditation sections. As I was going to have to split the screen into two sections.  The width was adjusted to 50% so as to make the two sections equal to fit the information.

I also wanted to ensure that both the yoga and meditaion sections were kept consistent in their structures as they would be holding similar questions on the left hand side.

**Left hand side of the screen**

1.What is Yoga/Meditation

2.What are the technique categories with supporting information.

3.A lesson on one of the categories.

**Right hand side of the screen**
1.What is Yoga/Meditation

2.What are the technique categories with supporting information.

3.A lesson on one of the categories.

1.Images

2.Video

The left side styling and structure was shown in the love running video by the Code Institute.  I adjusted the margin bottom to 100px so that it could fit better within the section.  I also floated it to the left.

The right side styling and setting of the structure was shown in the love running video by the Code Institute. There were some alignment issues with the right and left not matching up.  I had to adjust the bottom margin of the right side so that they were equal. I checked with the background colour blocks on the left about and right about id elements. These othat had been placed on the screen as a temporat

I added the structure for the left hand side of the meditation structure which was exactly the same as the yoga section and these had been shown on the love running video of the Code Institute.  I could see how both of the structures were the same and this helped to keep the whole site the same and consistent.

The right side of the meditation section for the structure and style was shown in the love running video by the Code Institute.  The process was the same as the yoga section and it has kept site the same and consistent.

I had to adjust the bottom height of right about heading class because it was out of alignment with the left side heading class.



The sign up section is credited to a video tutorial by "How to create Sign up & Login form with HTML and CSS" | Easy tutorial | By Code Info. 

I also found it useful to watch  "Forms In HTML and CSS | How To Create A Form | Learn HTML and CSS | HTML Tutorial | CSS Tutorial" by Dani Krossing, this helped me to understaand how the forms are structured. The submit form was kept simple in line with the rest of the layout for the site.  

The submit button was done in tomotoa red, so that the user could see, it is a form to fill in. I also checked on the colour coded chart by Lifewire, Jeremy Girard, to see what was the best text font colour for the submit button, done in tomotoa red.  On the chart, White as a text font colour was considered to be one of the best colours for visilbilty and design.

The addition of the social media icons in the footer was shown the the love running video by the Code Institute.

To style the social networks was taken from the love running video by the Code Institute and the the footer height was set to 300px and the font size was set to 400% so as to enable the icons to appear in line with the rest of the site.

Adding the styles to the yoga and meditation section, for the media queries for screen sizes below 1200px, was shown in the love running video by Code Institute. I did not have a centre-about so this was not added.

style setting for media queries below 950px was shown in the love running video by the Code Institute.

Adding styles to the yoga and meditation sections for mobile screens was shown on love running from the Code Institute.

The method to make inernal links work correctly was found in the LMS of the Code institute.

I placed the copyright section myself and used a div with a id="copyright" to set it up.

copyright information was found on the website termly.

How to use Gitpod and implementing the project is accredited to the Code Institute course material.

The Tutor Support helped me to sort out the initial technical issues with Gitpod especially with the Git Push error that Jo from Belgium helped me to sort out.

The Information about the five planes of User Experience Design are accredited to Jesse James Garrett as displayed in the UXD part of the code Institute course. This part of the course I found very useful especially in trying to understand what the user wishes to get from a service or website.  This helped me to think about the users needs more clearly.

Differentiating between User Experience and User Interface in the technology sector is attributed to Emil Lamprecht and Dee Scara from the Careerfoundary. Excellent video explaining the two roles in the industry.

I am grateful to Jim community_CI on the slack platform for forwarding a presentation on the preparation for the first milestone project. This helped me to be better organised with this project.

In relation to the positioning of items in CSS, one found the video by Deved to be very helpful.  One found the positiong of items to be challenging and one also looked into css tricks  and W3schools to find out how best to position items.

 **Reflective Learning Log**
I kept a reflective learning log so as to understand my own style of learning and what worked for me.  

I learnt that coding can be challenging and rewarding.

I learnt to keep things simple because then they are more effective.

I learnt that I will make mistakes and I have an opportuniy to learn from these mistakes.

I learnt that it is best to check the code on the validators regularly as it will highlight problems.

I learnt that I never stop learning.
