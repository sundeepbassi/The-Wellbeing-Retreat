 # The Wellbeing Retreat
 
 This project hopes to accomplish delivering lesson techniques on yoga and meditation to the users. Wellbeing has become an integral part of our lives. increasigly a work life balance promotes us into living happier and fuller lives.

**Strategy**

 This project hopes to target anyone interested in learning about yoga and meditation. The target audience can range from beginners to more advanced practioners. However this site is aims to provide body/mind techniques to people that are interested in learning more about these techniques. Therefore it is better suited to beginners.

 This will be useful to the target audience as it will give them an idea and techniques on how to do yoga and meditation for there wellbeing.

 Within the Code Institute User Experience module I found this process of User Experience Design to be very be very thought provoking.

 I formulated some questions to see what users would want from a Yoga and meditation site.

 1. What would you like to see about yoga and meditation on a site.
 
 2. what body/mind techniques would you like to learn about from the site?

 3. What information would you like to see on the site?

 4. What format would best enhance your learning i.e. lesson plans,video or audio?

 5. What social media contacts would you like to see incorporated on the site?

 I named the site The Wellbeing because I wanted to give the users a feeling that they were about to enter a retreat from where they could switch off from the outside world.

 I initially had the idea of using the title Yogimed and realised that this may give the user the wrong impression. As the end of the  word maybe misinterpreted to mean medical.

 I also thought about using the title Harmony for the site as the remit was to use body/mind self-improvement techniques. I realised that this would be too confusing for users as a 
 E harmony site already exists for people wishing to date.

 I realised that The Wellbeing Retreat incorparated this feeling body/mind self improvement techniques and it was a place to go and learn.


 **Scope**

 **The skeletal** 

In the skeletal process I first all did my basic plan on paper with an outline of how the site would be structured.

Then I used Balsamique to do a basic wireframe which i presented to my mentor and he recommended that I redo the wireframe so as to show better consistency and layout for the site. I appreciated his advice and I did an update of that wireframe.  As I was using Balsamique for the first time I had to get used to the functions.

 **Credits**

The code for the Meta data, implementing the boilerplate and implementing the folder and file structure was adopted from the Code Institute Love Running Walkthrough.

How to use Gitpod and implementing the project is accredited to the Code Institute course material.

The Tutor Support helped me to sort out the initial technical issues with Gitpod especially with the Git Push error that Jo from Belgium helped me to sort out.

The Information about the five planes of User Experience Design are accredited to Jesse James Garrett as displayed in the UXD part of the code Institute course. This part of the course I found very useful especially in trying to understand what the user wishes to get from a service or website.  This helped me to think about the users needs more clearly.

Differentiating between User Experience and User Interface in the technology sector is attributed to Emil Lamprecht and Dee Scara from the Careerfoundary. Excellent video explaining the two roles in the industry.

I am grateful to Jim community_CI on the slack platform for forwarding a presentation on the preparation for the first milestone project. This helped me to be better organised with this project.
