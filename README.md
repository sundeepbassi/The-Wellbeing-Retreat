 # The Wellbeing Retreat
 
 This project hopes to accomplish delivering lesson techniques on yoga and meditation to the users. Wellbeing has become an integral part of our lives. increasingly a work life balance enables us into living happier and fuller lives.

**User Experience Design**

**The Goals of the user**
1. To learn about self-improvement techniques
2. To feel comfortable in being able to use these self-improvement techniques.
3. To gain confidence in using these self-improvement techniques.
4. To have a better sense of wellbeing.
5. To enjoy the experience and to feel at ease on the site.

**The Goals for the Business**
1. To give the user a positive and intuitive experience.
2. To give the user an opportunity to learn about self-improvement techniques.
3. To promote the benefits of yoga and meditation.
4. To reach out to a wider audience that have not considered yoga and meditation before.
5. To enable the user to learn some skills in yoga and meditation.

**Strategy**

 This project hopes to target anyone interested in learning about yoga and meditation. The target audience is mainly aimed at beginners. However this site is aims to provide body/mind techniques to people that are interested in learning more about these techniques. 

 This will be useful to the target audience as it will give them an idea and techniques on how to do yoga and meditation for there wellbeing.

 Within the Code Institute User Experience module I found this process of User Experience Design to be important.

 I formulated some questions to see what users would want from a Yoga and meditation site.

 1. What would you like to see about yoga and meditation on a site.
 
 2. what body/mind techniques would you like to learn about from the site?

 3. What information would you like to see on the site?

 4. What format would best enhance your learning i.e. lesson plans,video or audio?

 5. What social media contacts would you like to see incorporated on the site?

 I named the site The Wellbeing because I wanted to give the users a feeling that they were about to enter a retreat from where they could switch off from the outside world.

 I initially had the idea of using the title Yogimed and realised that this may give the user the wrong impression. As the end of the  word maybe misinterpreted to mean medical.

 I also thought about using the title Harmony for the site as the remit was to use body/mind self-improvement techniques. I realised that this would be too confusing for users as a 
 E harmony site already exists for people wishing to date.

 I realised that The Wellbeing Retreat incorparated this feeling body/mind self improvement techniques and it was a place to go and learn.


 **Scope**

 **The skeletal** 

In the skeletal process I first all did my basic plan on paper with an outline of how the site would be structured.

Then I used Balsamique to do a basic wireframe which i presented to my mentor and he recommended that I redo the wireframe so as to show better consistency and layout for the site. I appreciated his advice and I did an update of that wireframe.  As I was using Balsamique for the first time I had to get used to the functions.

 **Font used on the Site**

 In considering the font for the site the article on Canva was helpful in viewing a number of fonts displayed on various websites. Bebas Neue was chosen because of the curviture and the shape appeared to be not too formal. At the same time considering it for a wellbeing project the font appeared to look somewhat wholistic and welcoming.

 **Landing Page**

 I decided to keep the landing page simple because I remember when I studied a short course at Birmingham City University the lecturer telling us that the best websites incorporated simplicity into their design like Google that only have a plain landing page with a search engine in the middle.  Thereby the users are not overwhelmed with too much information.

 **Navigation**

 I initially thought about having the navigation under the main heading, however I changed my mind when I watched a video by Kierstan Traboulsi from Evolve Marketing web design.  Kierstan explained with research and eye tracking software they have found that users eyes go to the upper top left hand side of a site and they scroll down in a F shape on the page.  I realised for an optimum user eperience that it was to use this F shape as a guide and to place the Navigation there.

 I also decided that I wanted to have the navigation in text form and not in a navigation bar as this may distract from the simplicity and consistency of the site.



 **The Wellbeing retreat**
This main header I want to put in the upper centre part of the landing page so as to enable the user to feel that they are not inudated with too information. The main heading in itself will explain what the site is for.

**The Statement**
The statement under the heading is to welcome users onto the site as one is welcomed into a shop or restaurant.  Allowing the user that they are valued in this process.

 **The Images on the Landing Page**
I decided to add two images here.
One will be a Yoga image.
Second one will be a meditation image.
The reason I decided to do this is because the aim is to develop a body/mind self-improvement techniques. Thereby each image will be representation of the body (a yoga pose) and the mind (someone sitting in meditation)
 
 **Yoga/Meditation**
 I wanted to make a note here that the layout for both the Yoga and Meditation sections need to be the same. I want the user to feel consistency and uniformity on these pages therefore their layout should be simple and effective.

 **The Yoga Section**
What is Yoga?
Where did it originate?
What are the techniques?
List the techniques
There will be a lesson on how to do one of the techniques.
There will be an image to compliment that technique.
There will be a video on how to do the technique.

 **The Meditation Section**
What is Meditation?
Where did it originate
What are the techniques? 
List the techniques.
There will be a lesson on how to do one of the techniques.
There be an image to compliment that technique.
There will be a video on how to do the technique.

 **Sign up Section**
The sign up section will have the following.
First Name and an input box
Surname and and input box
Email and and input box
A textarea for a user to submit a question or leave information.
A submit button

 **The Footer Section**
The footer will include icons for Twitter, facebook and instagram.  
There will be copyright information at the bottom.
Again I do not want to put the footer in different coloured area as I feel this may distract from the overall theme of the site.

 **Features Left to Implement**
I am thinking it would be good to have a section for teachers in the future.  There could also be a place to list a timetable of classes.  I think with covid it has high lighted the importance of social distancing and conducting classes over the web through zomm could be a good idea.

 **Credits**

The code for the Meta data, implementing the boilerplate and implementing the folder and file structure was adopted from the Code Institute Love Running Walkthrough.

How to use Gitpod and implementing the project is accredited to the Code Institute course material.

The Tutor Support helped me to sort out the initial technical issues with Gitpod especially with the Git Push error that Jo from Belgium helped me to sort out.

The Information about the five planes of User Experience Design are accredited to Jesse James Garrett as displayed in the UXD part of the code Institute course. This part of the course I found very useful especially in trying to understand what the user wishes to get from a service or website.  This helped me to think about the users needs more clearly.

Differentiating between User Experience and User Interface in the technology sector is attributed to Emil Lamprecht and Dee Scara from the Careerfoundary. Excellent video explaining the two roles in the industry.

I am grateful to Jim community_CI on the slack platform for forwarding a presentation on the preparation for the first milestone project. This helped me to be better organised with this project.

The ideas for the Font text were considered on the website canva written by Emma Norris
